Q1(a):
The pthread_create and pthread_join methods are given by the pthread
library, the pthread create function takes four parameteres,
the first parameter points towards the thread object, the second parameter
is a pointer to the attributes of the thread is usually passed null, 
the third argument is the function which the thread executes; 
the fourth argument is the pointer to a function you need to start the
 thread with; can be passed as null if isn't needed.

Output:
The words hello and world, each are executed 10 times; due to the functions
thread1() & thread2(). As we don't know when each thread will execute;
there's no order of them when they're printing. 

Q2(a) 20000000
(b) Thread 1, counter = 14156504
Thread 0, counter = 14944538

(c) The error is quite large and is inconsistent; as can be seen in the 
screenshots.

(d) It rougly takes a second or even less to run on my system.
